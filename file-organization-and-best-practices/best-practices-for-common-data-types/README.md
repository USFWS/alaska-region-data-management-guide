# Best Practices for Common Data Types

There are a few very common types of data generated by Alaska Region projects. These are tabular data, databases, geospatial data, collections of similar types of data \(digital images, data logger outputs, etc.\), and source data \(data not generated by the project but used during the course of the project. For example, data used to inform project design\). Best practices for organizing these types of data for the archive folder are described below. More specific guidance and trainings will be developed for each data type in the future.

Guidance is also provided on converting data formats produced from commonly used programs \(e.g., MS Office or ESRI ArcGIS\) into preferred open formats. These formats are preferred for archive folder purposes because they are independent of any particular software program. That means that they can be opened by users with a variety of applications and that they are resilient to software application upgrades or obsolescence that can degrade proprietary formats over time.
