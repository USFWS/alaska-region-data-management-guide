# Best Practices for Common Data Types

There are a few common types of data generated by Alaska Region projects. These are tabular data, databases, geospatial data, collections of similar types of data \(digital images, data logger outputs, etc.\), and source data \(data not generated by the project but used during the course of the project. For example, data used to inform project design\).

Described in the following sections are the best practices for organizing these types of data for the archive folder. Additional guidance and training for each data type are part of the plans for the future.

 Information is also available for converting data formats produced from commonly used programs \(e.g., MS Office or ESRI ArcGIS\) into preferred open formats. These formats are preferred for archive folder purposes because they are independent of any particular software program, meaning that they can be opened by users with a variety of applications and that they are resilient to software application upgrades or obsolescence that can degrade proprietary formats over time.
