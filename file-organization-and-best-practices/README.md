# File Organization and Best Practices

There is a distinction between working folders and archive folders; development of the latter is the focus of this document. Working folders often exist on an individual’s computer hard drive and are used to collect, organize, and analyze products during the course of the project. In contrast, archive folders are used to store final products that are meant to be discoverable and accessible over a long period of time. The products in the archive folder are the subject of metadata records. 

Consistent archive folder organization across projects and programs allows the file creator, collaborators, supervisors, and our future colleagues to find relevant documents associated with a project quickly and understand how documents relate to one another. A tree structure describing the recommended file structure is presented in [Appendix B](../appendix-b-tree-structure-for-file-organization-of-the-archive-record.md). 

When a new project archive folder needs to be initiated, contact your Data Stewardship Team \(DST\) member. They will set up the folder structure on your program’s network drive and apply the appropriate read/write permissions with IT staff \(see Security and Preservation section\). The folder will be named using a short acronym for your program, followed by a three digit number, followed by the short title of the project \(e.g., FRP\_001\_BarrowEider where FRP stands for Fairbanks Recovery Program\). Access to this record and backup practices are discussed in the Security and Preservation section of this guide.
