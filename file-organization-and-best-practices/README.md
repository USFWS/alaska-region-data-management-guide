# File Organization and Best Practices

Working folders often exist on an individualâ€™s computer hard drive and are used to collect, organize, and analyze products \(data\) during the course of the project. However, this document focuses on how to create the **archive folders** used to store final products that must be discoverable and accessible over a long period. The products in the archive folder are the subject of metadata records.

Consistent archive folder organization across projects and programs allows the file creator, collaborators, supervisors, and our future colleagues to find relevant documents associated with a project quickly and understand how documents relate to one another. A tree structure describing the recommended file structure is in [**Appendix B**](../appendix-b-tree-structure-for-file-organization-of-the-archive-record.md)**.** 

  
 To start a new project archive folder, contact your Data Stewardship Team \(DST\) representative. They will set up the folder structure on a shared network drive and apply the appropriate read/write permissions with IT staff \(see Security and Preservation section\). The DST will name the folder using a short acronym for your program, followed by a three-digit number, followed by the short title of the project \(e.g., FRP\_001\_BarrowEider where FRP stands for Fairbanks Recovery Program\). The Security and Preservation section of this guide discusses how to access these records and backup best practices
