# Establish Roles and Responsibilities

It is critical that there be a clear agreement on individual roles and responsibilities in terms of data management and documentation. It is also important that others know whom to contact to obtain more information about projects and products or the source data.  

Clearly identify a person or position for the following roles:

1. **Project Manager**:  Often this role is synonymous with the projectâ€™s principal investigator. The Project Manager is responsible for the management of the project and all of the associated data products, including project metadata creation. They are accountable for ensuring that the project performs as described in the project and data management plans. The Project Manager is responsible for any identified roles that remain unassigned.
2. **Data Originator\(s\)**: The data originator\(s\) is the person\(s\) generating or collecting data. They are responsible for data they collect, author or generate. They are responsible for following best practices for the data type, including creating product metadata.
3. **Data Custodian**:    The data custodian is the person responsible for the management of the project archive folder.
4. **Data Steward**: The data steward is a subject-matter expert tasked with reviewing and approving the data products, including documentation. The data steward is also responsible for building the project-product associations between metadata records. 
5. **Data Trustee**:    The data trustee is an upper level position in the organization that has ultimate responsibility for ensuring the allocation of adequate resources \(e.g. staff and funding\) to allow for completion of all aspects of data management. The trustee also has final responsibility to ensure the application of governance policies to the project and resulting data resources. The trustee will most likely not be involved with data management, but rather with data governance.

**Note**: One individual may fill many roles. In many cases, the Project Manager may serve in all roles with the exception of Data Trustee. It is best practice for the Project Manager and the Data Steward to be different individuals, but project staffing levels may not allow for this.
