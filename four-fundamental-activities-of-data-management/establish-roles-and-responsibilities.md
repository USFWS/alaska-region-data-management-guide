# Establish Roles and Responsibilities

It is critical that there be an explicit agreement on individual roles and responsibilities in terms of data management and documentation. It is also important that others know who to contact to obtain more information about projects and products or the source data. 

Explicitly identify a person or position in the following roles:

1. **Project Manager**: this may be synonymous with the projectâ€™s principal investigator. Responsible for the management of the project and all associated data products. Responsible for ensuring that the project is performed as described in the project and data management plans. If a particular required role is not explicitly identified, it is the responsibility of the Project Manager to perform the necessary tasks. Responsible for project metadata creation. 
2. **Data Originator\(s\)**: person\(s\) generating/collecting data. Responsible for data they collect, author or generate. Responsible for following best practices for the data type. Responsible for product metadata creation.
3. **Data Custodian**: person responsible for the management of the project archive folder. 
4. **Data Steward**: subject-matter expert\(s\) responsible for reviewing and approving the data products, including documentation. Responsible for building the project-product associations between metadata records. 
5. **Data Trustee**: an upper level position in the organization that has ultimate responsibility for ensuring that adequate resources \(e.g. staff and funding\) are allocated to allow for completion of all aspects of data management. The trustee also has ultimate responsibility to ensure that governance policies are applied to the project and resultant data resources. The trustee will most likely not be involved with data management, but rather with data governance.

Note that one individual may fill many roles. In many cases, the Project Manager may serve in all roles with the exception of Data Trustee. It is best practice for the Project Manager and the Data Steward to be different individuals, but project staffing levels may not allow for this.
