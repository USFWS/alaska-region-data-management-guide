# Documentation

Project Managers and Data Originators will write metadata or data about the data, using the mdEditor \([mdEditor.org](https://www.mdeditor.org/)\). mdEditor is a web-based application developed by the Alaska Data Integration Working Group \([ADIwg](https://www.adiwg.org/)\) that allows data-generators to write archival-quality metadata without specialized technical knowledge. 

It is highly recommended that new users first work through the [mdEditor Tutorial](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/tutorial/welcome-to-tutorial.html) to become acquainted with the layout and functionality of mdEditor. Guidance on how to write documentation is in the Alaska Region Metadata Guide and supported by hands-on workshops.

As a quick checklist, information to gather for projects and products includes:

* Title
* Roles and responsibilities
* Contact information for project staff
* Abstract
* Start date
* End date
* Keywords
* Focal species in the project
* Spatial extent
* Data dictionaries \(for some product types\)
* Protocols used in the project
