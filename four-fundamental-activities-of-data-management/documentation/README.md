# Documentation

Metadata, or data about the data, will be written using the mdEditor \([mdEditor.org](http://mdeditor.org)\). mdEditor is a web-based application developed by the Alaska Data Integration Working Group [\(ADIwg](https://www.adiwg.org/about/)\) that allows data-generators to write archival-quality metadata without specialized technical knowledge. mdEditor JSON files will be exported to the incoming folder and ultimately saved to the project archive folder in the metadata folder.

It is highly recommended that new users first work through the [mdEditor Tutorial](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/tutorial/welcome-to-tutorial.html) to become acquainted with the layout and functionality of mdEditor. Step-by-step guidance on writing documentation can be found at the [Alaska Region Metadata Guide](https://ak-region-dst.gitbook.io/alaska-region-mdeditor-interim-user-guide/) and will be supported by hands-on workshops.
