# Security and Preservation

Establishing one archive folder for each project prevents data loss and ensures data integrity. The archive folder for a project comprised of the recommended file structure [**Appendix** **B**](../appendix-b-tree-structure-for-file-organization-of-the-archive-record.md) and described in [File Organization and Best Practices](../file-organization-and-best-practices/) section, and placed on the shared network drive. The Data Custodian \(see [Establish Roles and Responsibilities](establish-roles-and-responsibilities.md)\) will have read/write permissions to all folders in the archive folder. All other users with access to the program’s network drive will have write permissions to an “incoming” folder and read-only permissions to all other folders. The incoming folder allows anyone with access to the program’s network drive to contribute products and associated metadata records to the archive folder, the Data Steward is responsible for reviewing these files and the Data Custodian is responsible for moving them from the incoming folder to the appropriate folder in the archive folder. 

Anyone with access to the program’s network drive can copy the archive folder to their local hard drive and maintain the files on their hard drive in whatever manner they choose, but may only move things into the archive folder via the incoming folder. 

Although the archive folder is on the network drive to allow broad access to one definitive version of the project and its data, IT does not currently manage the network drive as an archive. Each individual designated as a Data Trustee \(see Establish Roles and Responsibilities\) for at least one project will have an external hard drive at their workstation that is set up to perform daily backups of all projects that they administer. For example, the Branch Chief of a program will have an external hard drive at their workstation that backs up the archive folders of all projects in their program. 

Recommended most often is that all workstations have an external hard drive set up to perform daily backups of its hard drive as well..
